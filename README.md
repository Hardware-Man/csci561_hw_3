This repository is for HW 3 of my CSCI 561 Foundations of AI course at USC.

This project had me implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and use it to solve a classification task on real-world data from the New York housing market. For details on the project, consult the [`hw3-csci561-sp24.pdf`](https://github.com/Hardware-Man/csci561_hw_3/blob/main/hw3-csci561-sp24.pdf) file.
